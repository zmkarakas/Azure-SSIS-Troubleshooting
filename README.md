# Azure-SSIS-Troubleshooting

Continuing from my previous detailing of my experience as an ADF, Synapse and Stream Analytics engineer for Azure, I wanted to give insight into frequently encountered problems in Azure-SSIS integration, including VNet injection complications, package execution failures, SSIS-IR related issues, SSISDB related issues, vice versa.

Similar to my ADF dataflow overview, I will be looking at SystemErrors and UserErrors separately. Besides these two classifications, these errors can also be grouped into two categories; Azure-SSIS IR related issues such as provisioning problems, or PackageExecution failures such as connectivity to SSISDB internal failures. Another classification/categorization can be made between transient and persistent error types.
