# Azure-SSIS-Troubleshooting

Continuing from my previous detailing of my experience as an ADF, Synapse and Stream analytics enginner in Azure for over a year, I wanted to give insight into frequently encountered problems in Azure-SSIS integration, including VNet injection complications, package execution failures, SSIS-IR related issues, SSISDB related issues, vice versa.

Unlike my ADF dataflow overview, I will be looking at SystemErrors and UserErrors together.
